                <h3>Financial Management:</h3>
                The various sources of fund for organization include membership fees, donations and contributions, Government and Non-government Institution. The amount received from any source is spent only on the purpose for which it was released. To ensure transparency,
                joint signatories (two office bearers) operate the bank account. The original vouchers are kept for each expense under its budget head, and accounts are kept following double entry system. The Chartered accountant audits these accounts
                in each financial year (01 April to 31 March).

                <h3>Operational Strategy:</h3>
                Gram Seva Sansthan primarily works with the network of community based organizations. It recognizes that for the sustained development of the region, strong village institutions are essential. The planning for any development intervention was done in
                consultation with them considering the needs and priority of the community. The GSS considers community mobilization as an important aspect of the program involving physical works as it brings in sustainability to it.

                        <h3>Our Success</h3>
                        <p>From the very beginning GSS realized the potential of its strength that it drew from the masses and has over the years made its presence felt in the region through a series of campaigns to root out various social evils from this
                            region besides organizing masses for forest protection, water conservation and watershed management. The efforts of GSS resulted in the stopping of naach tradition that degraded females.</p>

                        <p>In 1986 GSS initiated chipko movement in Dwari and the administration was compelled to review the forest policy. With the support of the MMDs voluntary restrictions were: imposed upon lopping and felling of trees in the surrounding
                            forests and a massive afforestation drive was undertaken to revive the forests. These initiatives paid dividends and appreciably good oak forest has come up in the region.</p>

                        <p>The advocacy of GSS has borne fruits at present the jungles in the surrounding villages are managed by the MMDs and lopping is regulated and done systematically so that the forest gets ample time to regenerate. These a forestation
                            measures resulted in enhanced water resources in the region. Many new springs have appeared at the slope break below the jungle while many seasonal springs have become perennial.</p>

                        <p>GSS from the very beginning appreciated the traditional measures taken by the people for resource management in the region. And it was amongst the admirers of traditional chaals (water harvesting / recharge enhancing structures)
                            and with the support of FORRAD it built 50 chaals (traditional recharge pits) in this region for Enhancing recharge of groundwater and thus to increase the yield of the springs. These have significantly enhanced the spring
                            yields besides impeding the pace of running water resulting in reduced rates of mass wastage.</p>
