                        <p>From the very' beginning GSS has been deeply conceded about the drudgery of women of the region who shoulder most of the workload of agricultural and allied operations besides taking care of the household. The Sansthan realized
                            the latent potential and strength of the hardy hill women and organized them to initiate social change at grassroots level. In all the movements so far launched by the sansthan, females have played a key role and sansthan has
                            no hesitation in sharing the success of these movements with the females of the region. .</p>


                        <p>The female groups; Mahila Mangal Dais (MMD)) as these are called over here, are established in almost all the villages of the region to gamer support of the females who comprise majority of the labour force in the hills due to
                            the out migration of able bodied men folk. MMDs were first organized in Gona and Bhatgaon in 1978, and it was followed by MMD at Lodas in 1981. Since then there has been no looking back and at present GSS has organized 30 MMDs
                            in the region.</p>


                        <p>Aided by Uttarakhand Sewa Nidhi, Almora GSS has strengthened its presence in 12 villages where it runs balwari (child nursery) program. Besides taking due care of the children and providing basic health facilities the ba/wari worKers
                            have helped in bringing about awareness amongst the masses. Even in the earlier stages of its inception GSS realized the importance of awareness drive 'through mass campaigns and since then it has been agitating the masses
                            through its innovative puppet shows that it has by now mastered. Through its awareness drives GSS agitated the females of the region over the cause of depleting forest resources and its implications over the day to day life
                            of the villagers.</p>


                        <p>To reduce the drudgery of the females of the region who had to walk stirringly long distances to get the flour milled and oil pressed GSS has established a flour mill accompanied by an oil press in its premises.</p>

                        <p>
                            To save the villagers from any extra burden age old system of taking flour in lieu of the milling charges has been retained. As commercial energy is not available to the masses of the region, they take recourse to fuel wood for their energy requirements.
                            Fuel wood collection takes toll of a major portion of the productive time of the females and they are deprived from contributing towards other productive pursuits that result in their degraded social status.
                        </p>

                        <p>To add to it smoke emanating from the fuel wood results in many a lung and eye ailments. In order to provide easy access to energy and to improve the socio-economic condition of there females GSS installed 15 biogas plants in this
                            region for demonstration purpose.</p>
