                        <h2> BEST PRACTICES</h2>
                        <p> From the very beginning GSS realized the potential of its strength that it drew from the masses and has over the years made its presence felt in the region through a series of campaigns to root out various social evils from this
                            region besides organizing masses for forest protection, water conservation and watershed management. The efforts of GSS resulted in the stopping of naach tradition that degraded females. In 1986 GSS initiated chipko movement
                            in Dwari and the administration was compelled to review the forest policy. With the support of the MMDs voluntary restrictions were: imposed upon lopping and felling of trees in the surrounding forests and a massive afforestation
                            drive was undertaken to revive the forests. These initiatives paid dividends and appreciably good oak forest has come up in the region. The advocacy of GSS has borne fruits at present the jungles in the surrounding villages
                            are managed by the MMDs and lopping is regulated and done systematically so that the forest gets ample time to regenerate. These a forestation measures resulted in enhanced water resources in the region. Many new springs have
                            appeared at the slope break below the jungle while many seasonal springs have become perennial. GSS from the very beginning appreciated the traditional measures taken by the people for resource management in the region. And
                            it was amongst the admirers of traditional chaals (water harvesting / recharge enhancing structures) and with the support of FORRAD it built 50 chaals (traditional recharge pits) in this region for Enhancing recharge of groundwater
                            and thus to increase the yield of the springs. These have significantly enhanced the spring yields besides impeding the pace of running water resulting in reduced rates of mass wastage. See More Next Update……

                        <h1>BEST PRACTICES</h1>
                        <p> From the very beginning GSS realized the potential of its strength that it drew from the masses and has over the years made its presence felt in the region through a series of campaigns to root out various social evils from this
                            region besides organizing masses for forest protection, water conservation and watershed management. The efforts of GSS resulted in the stopping of naach tradition that degraded females. In 1986 GSS initiated chipko movement
                            in Dwari and the administration was compelled to review the forest policy. With the support of the MMDs voluntary restrictions were: imposed upon lopping and felling of trees in the surrounding forests and a massive afforestation
                            drive was undertaken to revive the forests. These initiatives paid dividends and appreciably good oak forest has come up in the region. The advocacy of GSS has borne fruits at present the jungles in the surrounding villages
                            are managed by the MMDs and lopping is regulated and done systematically so that the forest gets ample time to regenerate. These a forestation measures resulted in enhanced water resources in the region. Many new springs have
                            appeared at the slope break below the jungle while many seasonal springs have become perennial. GSS from the very beginning appreciated the traditional measures taken by the people for resource management in the region. And
                            it was amongst the admirers of traditional chaals (water harvesting / recharge enhancing structures) and with the support of FORRAD it built 50 chaals (traditional recharge pits) in this region for Enhancing recharge of groundwater
                            and thus to increase the yield of the springs. These have significantly enhanced the spring yields besides impeding the pace of running water resulting in reduced rates of mass wastage. See More Next Update……
